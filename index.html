                        I run one DNS nameserver with IPv6 anycasted from perdix (southeast coast of the US) and icarus (north-central Ukraine).
                        IPv4 is pointed to mango (southeastern coast of US). When resolving things, it's preferred to use the v6 of this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I run another DNS nameserver with an IPv6 from a Hurricane Electric tunnel, and an IPv4 pointed to kuckuck
                        (northeastern coast of US). This nameserver is located completely in the US and latencies can run high sometimes, so it's
                        probably not the best idea to use this server, but it works. Also, if ns1 is down, ns2 is *probably* down as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>I only really have one European PoP (icarus in Ukraine), so everything goes through there...</p>

                    <h2>What's there to look forward to in the future?</h2>
                    <p>I'm hoping to expand my PoP's using Vultr + broadcasting routes. Also, I'd love to get myself an ASN...</p>
                    <p>
                        Aside from that, I also hope to run <a href="https://github.com/ohnx/mail">my mail server</a> on mango and a vultr PoP (maybe in EU or in australia)!

                    <p>
                        I would also like to run my own tunneling service... Not too sure how it would work, but something along the lines of a v4 or v6 client connecting to my server
                        and then me giving the client a /128 to play around with is my idea. Kind of like with <a href="https://ngrok.io/">ngrok</a>, but instead of a single port,
                        you make your entire IP public! Also kind of like with <a href="https://tunnelbroker.net/">tunnelbroker.net</a>, but with /128's instead of /64's since I'm
                        not a LIR with infinite /64's (technically I have 16777216 /64's I think but still, I have a bunch that are "reserved for future use").

                        Because I don't understand CSS and HTML and I can't get my footer to display at the bottom of the page correctly if there is not enough text filling the page!
                        My solution to this is to write more things and make sure that the page will overflow on as many screens as possible instead of fixing the CSS :)
