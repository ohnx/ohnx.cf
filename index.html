                    <p>There's not much here that could pique the interest of anyone other than me right now... expect to see more in the future!</p>

                        Most of the stuff on <b>ohnx.cf</b> is actually only accessible from a VPN.
                        Actually, if you can see this page right now, you probably aren't connected through the VPN! (and thus won't be able to see anything cool, sorry)

                    <p>
                        I used to run a few things on here, including a DNS server for this domain and rDNS, but I stopped doing that after losing some PoP's. :(
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I run <a href="https://github.com/ohnx/mail">my mail server</a> @ this domain on midas (new midas; northeastern coast of US).
                        A number of domains all have their mail handled by the same server running on new midas.
                        This mail server was migrated from another server (mango) that has since gone down.

                    <p>
                        I currently lack a European PoP, so I will probably end up getting one on the free credit I have with Vultr in the near future.
                        Asia-Pacific is also a possible future PoP region! I'm hoping to anycast a DNS server across some regions so I can have reverse DNS
                        and stuff running nicely. Of course, I first need to fix up my DNS server that I wrote (I don't even remember where the most recent version of the
                        code is anymore) to be backed by something that can replicate globally...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would also like to run my own tunneling service... Not too sure how it would work, but something along the lines of a v4 or v6 client connecting to my server
                        and then me giving the client a /64 to play around with is my idea. Kind of like with <a href="https://ngrok.io/">ngrok</a>, but instead of a single port,
                        you make your entire computer public! Also kind of like with <a href="https://tunnelbroker.net/">tunnelbroker.net</a>, but with simpled configuration
                        (e.g. ngrok). I have a lot of IPv6's thanks to <a href="http://ip6.im/">a very cool service</a>, and I plan on using at least some of this for this purpose :)

                        Because the internet is fun! Experimenting is the best way to learn :)

                        Because I don't understand CSS and HTML and I can't get my footer to display at the bottom of the page correctly if there is not enough text filling the page!
                        My solution to this is to write more things and make sure that the page will overflow on as many screens as possible instead of fixing the CSS :)
